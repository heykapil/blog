I have recently taken admission in Ph.D. and was eligible for the CSIR JRF-NET fellowship. But there was not much clear instructions available for new fellows at the csir website, NEWFMS Portal and any other place. So, this post is for the new jrf fellows who wants to activate their csir fellowship.'

 **1. About CSIR JRF-NET** 
The National eligibility exam (NET) is conducted by National Testing Agency (NTA) on behalf of CSIR and UGC. A number of candidate who get good ranks are declared JRF and such candidates are eligible for fellowship if they apply for the research in India.
